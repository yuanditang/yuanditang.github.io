Hi, I’m Yuandi Tang, a data-driven professional who recently graduated with a [Master’s in Marketing Communication Research and Data Analytics from Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/com/academics/media-science/ms-in-media-science-marketing-communication-research/). I am now pursuing a [Master’s in Data Science from Northeastern University](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-data-science-boston-5256/), bringing seven years of marketing experience, and am now transitioning into a data-focused role, excited to merge my expertise in marketing strategy and customer engagement with advanced data analytics.

In my career, I’ve led marketing campaigns across diverse channels, achieving measurable results and optimizing strategies through data insights. Tools like Excel, SQL, and visualization platforms have allowed me to uncover actionable trends, driving efficiency and innovation. This passion for data-driven solutions inspired my transition to harness data more rigorously in shaping impactful strategies.

I thrive in collaborative environments and excel at bridging communication between technical insights and business objectives. My ability to connect cross-functionally enables me to align initiatives with organizational goals effectively. Beyond work, I’m deeply committed to advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts through volunteering with organizations like NAAAP Boston, Cradles to Crayons, and Boston Cares.

In my personal life, cooking Chinese food is my creative outlet and a way to share my cultural heritage. I find joy in experimenting with flavors and connecting with others through the universal language of food.

Let’s connect to discuss how I can bring a blend of marketing, data, and communication skills to create impactful solutions!(https://www.instagram.com/bucomgrad/), still a volunteer of [Cradles to Crayons](https://www.cradlestocrayons.org/), [GBFB](https://www.gbfb.org/),[Boston Cares](https://www.bostoncares.org/),[Pan Mass Challenge](pmc.org) and [NAAAP Boston](https://www.naaapboston.org/). Whether advocating for equitable practices within the workplace or engaging in community initiatives, I am dedicated to fostering environments where everyone feels valued and heard.

Glad to know you and hope to connect with you soon!
