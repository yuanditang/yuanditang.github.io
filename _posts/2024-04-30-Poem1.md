Stop Requested, Doors Open
/nA surge of youthful motivations rushes into the bus
/nPulling windows, seats shaking
/nShouting, yelling, running back and forth

Poker Face, Earphones On
I remain indifferent as Alicia Keys sings loudly
Great piano, calm voice
Those mischievous ones should really leave

“Some people want it all”, ALL YOU GUYS STUPID ENOUGH
“If it ain't you, baby If I ain't got you”, YOU GIVE ME SOME SNACK

Sudden Lights, Nothing Annoys
14-year-old me with the same desire
Earphones off, smiling with boys
Youth is a gift that I deeply admire

Stop Requested, Doors Open
I move slower as my body rusts
Shouts continue, bus waving
Embrace the past and enjoy what lasts

“Some people want it all”, only cherish when it's gone
“If I ain't got youth, baby”, I silently sing along
