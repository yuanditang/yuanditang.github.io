Sunshine graces the public garden with its golden light,   
A stone's throw away lies the groceries, a hustle sight.   
Not far off stands the happy mart, a place of delight,   
Where luxury shops shimmer, a true urbanite's right.   
   
Sliding carefree by the government center's grand display,   
Bowing in respect at the serene cemetery's array.   
Peering through the green boat car, life's colors at play,   
Navigating arbitrary roads, in the city's ballet.   

A gentle breeze whispers secrets into my eyes,   
I shut them briefly, lost in nature's sweet guise.   
Oranges leap from my bag, a fruity surprise,   
Diving into the pond, transforming before my eyes.   

Lettuce stretches out, becoming a lush green lawn,   
Blueberries roll, a dance of colors at dawn.   
Drizzling lettuce with tiny blue flowers, nature's drawn,   
Celery pillars the bridges, a sight to fawn.   

Jazz music plays, a melody for the snake charming show,   
Hey the magic journey, where life's rhythms flow.
