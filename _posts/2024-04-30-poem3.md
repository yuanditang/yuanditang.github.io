Lost in the chaos, my life slips from my grasp,   
A constant struggle, an overwhelming task.   
Unable to rise with the morning sun's light,   
No joy in sight, just a dim, hazy plight.

Lying idle in bed, aimless and lost,   
Aching neck, a burden, a painful cost.   
Procrastination rules, till the final hour,   
Questions linger, without reason or power.

This unfamiliar state, a stranger to me,   
Should I seek answers, from the divine decree?   
Or consult a psychic, to uncover what may be,   
Three months since loss, a heavy heart, can't you see?

Should I push forward, work harder, and strive,   
But attempts have faltered, failed to survive.   
In a sea of misfortune, where I'm adrift,   
Why, oh why, this relentless, painful rift?

Must I become a robot, devoid of thought,   
Moving forward, with emotions all but naught.   
Seeking solace in numbness, a silent accord,   
In this journey, where hope is restored.
